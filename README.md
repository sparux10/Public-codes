i creat my alert cause i don't like the alert in js

<h2>how to import showAlert</h2>
<h3>in js file</h3>
<div style="color: green;">import {showAlert} from 'showAlert'</div>
<h3>in html file</h3>
<div style="color: green;">"<script type="module" src="showAlert.js"></script>"</div>

<h2>how it's work</h2>
<h4>
there is four parameters for this function and they are:
 showAlert(title_P, TypeM_P, message_P, color_P)
 1: title_P : title 
 2: TypeM_P: type of message like warning, message, importent ....
 3: message_P: you can set what you want to show as you do with the normal alert 
 4: color_P: it's a color for the button so that i prefer set the green for the good alerts and the red for the bad one
